This repository contains the supporting python scripts for the manuscript "Quantifying uncertainty of incipient motion thresholds in gravel-bedded rivers using a grain-scale force-balance model" By S.A. Feehan, S.W. McCoy, J.S. Scheingross, and M.H. Gardner. Included are the codes to create figures 1 â€“ 5: the generation of force balance parameter (FBP) distributions, Monte Carlo simulations, exploration of the influence of roughness layer (k_s) and vertical grain location on uncertainty estimates, estimation of power law coefficients given varying assumptions of the physical constraints, and matching of the predicted entrainment thresholds against flume and field data, and show how variations in the threshold for incipient motion can explain scatter in existing measurements of bedload flux. This material is provided in individual python scripts along with data compilation for comparison. 

These codes were designed for the analysis presented in Feehan et. al. 2023, JGR-Earth Surface.  Alternate uses may require modification.

Codes were written by Scott Feehan and Scott McCoy. Questions can be directed to Scott Feehan (sfeehan@nevada.unr.edu).
